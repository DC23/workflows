This lesson focuses on techniques to automate data analysis pipelines with two modern workflow engines:
 [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
 [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).

After completing this lesson you should have a good understanding of the role
of workflow engines and the value they can bring to complex data processing.
Additionally, by implementing the same workflow in two different systems, you
will start to understand some of the strengths and limitations of each.
Hopefully this will help you choose the best approach for your own work.

There are 2 primary components to this lesson. Each component is budgeted
half a day's worth of teaching-time, resulting in a one day workshop.

At the end of this lesson, you will:

* Understand the benefits of workflow engines.
* Be able to create reproducible analysis pipelines in Snakemake and Nextflow.
* Be aware of some of the relative strengths and weakness of Snakemake and Nextflow.

## Pre-requisites

FIXME: add links to relevant Data School lessons.

* Some basic Python programming experience, ideally in Python 3.
* Familiarity with running programs on a command line.

FIXME: adjust setup instructions to link to main setup page instead.
