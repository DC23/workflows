Zipf's Law
: In the field of quantitative linguistics, Zipf's Law states that the
frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency
table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as
the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most
frequent word, etc.: the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation
(source: [Wikipedia][zipf]).
