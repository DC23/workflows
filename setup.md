title: Setup
---

There are several pieces of software you will wish to install before the workshop.
Though installation help will be provided at the workshop,
we recommend that these tools are installed (or at least downloaded) beforehand.
Anaconda Python is a very large download.

## Python 3 and Snakemake

Please install Anaconda from [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
(however any version of Python 3 will work).
Anaconda is a free version of Python that comes bundled with all of its most useful tools.
Even better, it includes several significant performance improvements over "vanilla" Python.

You can install Snakemake with `pip install --user snakemake`
